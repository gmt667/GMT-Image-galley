ðŸŒ„ GMT â€“ Image Gallery with Lightbox  
Description:
The GMT â€“ Image Gallery with Lightbox is a clean, responsive web-based image gallery designed to display multiple images with an interactive lightbox effect. Users can click on any thumbnail image to open a larger version of the image in a centered pop-up overlay, known as a lightbox. This feature enhances user experience by allowing users to focus on individual images without leaving the current page.

When an image is clicked, the lightbox overlays the entire screen with a semi-transparent dark background, bringing the selected image to the forefront. A close button (Ã—) is positioned in the top-right corner of the screen, and users can also click outside the image or press the **Escape key** to close the lightbox.

To improve the visual experience, the gallery includes smooth hover effects on thumbnails, giving a zoom-in transition when the mouse hovers over each image. The layout is built using **Flexbox**, which allows it to adapt responsively across different screen sizes and devices.

This image gallery can be easily customized to display different sets of images and is ideal for showcasing photos, portfolios, product shots, or events. Itâ€™s lightweight, user-friendly, and can be enhanced further with features like navigation arrows, captions, or image descriptions.
